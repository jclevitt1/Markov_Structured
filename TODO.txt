TODO'S:
3.16
1. Fitting continuous PDF to a model. Of course lognormal to returns is default options, but BLACK SWAN event
is VERY BAD for this. Probably will have higher returns than other distributions that account for black swan events.

Recommendation from YT video watched was FRACTAL CASCADE MODELLING. I know nothing about this, but remember from the vid
it made sense lmao. Look into this and determine if it is worth fitting daily returns to.

2. Add Sharpe Ratio, Sotrino, Max Drawdown metrics to reports of each model.

3. Make value report generation have an 'AGGREGATE' option in which it takes in a list of tickers and judges performance
based on the entire list given.

4. COL_TO_MA may be messing up my technical var's. :( check on the implementation of each.

3.10 Other Things To Think About
1. Overall model scoring- how to approach this?

2. Using scoring system in strategy determiner to be optimizing function for some ML fit algo

3. HEAVILY PUNISH THE YEARLY DEVIATION IN ALPHA (will have to do some cleanup to not include the remainder yr if less than
a certain no of days.

EVENTUALLY

---

Place we left off:
1. Implmeenting the "maximum return function" given state space & historical data to have immediate benchmark.

2. Begin making state spaces for TA variables and doing state space analysis.

* Implement state determiner, markov strategy, for Czech volatility and volume.

* Implement the first derivative strategy to modify transition probabilities to be even more accurate.

* Begin to devise strategy on identifying powerful combinations of comobo states from intersecting Markov models.

* Think over if empirical probability calculation is powerful enough for transition probability matrix.

* think about how to integrate the theoretic

* Implement abstraction of basic feature selection dependent on markov state determiner

* Implement abstraction of strategy determiner based on the start --> finish by the strategydeterminer.

* Implement some sort of caching system here. For now, we want functions such as "give max return for state space",
which calls a lot of functions we will be calling in the report generation process.

THE NAME OF THE GAME IS COMING UP WITH ACCURATE TRANSITION PROBABILITIES, NOT JUST FOR THE 1D, 1D CASE OF
TRANSITION PROBABILITY MATRIX ON A SINGLE MARKOV STATE DETERMINER.
