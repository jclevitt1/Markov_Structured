An ordered state space is a state space that can be ranked. Given an ordered state space, I will necessitate the state
determiner to have a function f that assigns different values to this state space.

f: State Space --> [-1, 1] Where 0 is "neutral" +1 is highest rank, -1 is lowest rank.

This will be used when assessing the value of a state space & seeing its covariance with other metrics in the data.
